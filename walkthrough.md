## üåü What Is This Project?

Hi! This is **Olivia's Softball Quiz Machine** - it's like having a really smart softball coach on your computer or phone that asks you questions about softball and helps you learn!

Think of it like this:
- üè´ **School**: You have different subjects (math, reading, science)
- ü•é **Our App**: We have different softball subjects (batting, pitching, fielding, base running)
- üìù **School**: Your teacher gives you tests to see what you know
- ü§ñ **Our App**: Our computer "teacher" creates questions just for you!

---

## üéØ The Big Picture: How Does It All Work?

Imagine our app is like a **magical softball coaching machine**:

### 1. üé™ **The Welcome Mat** (WelcomeScreen)
- Like walking into a softball camp - we greet you and explain the rules
- Shows you what you're going to do
- Has a special "memory" so if you've been here before, we can skip this part

### 2. üéõÔ∏è **The Control Panel** (QuizSetupScreen)  
- Like choosing your difficulty level in a video game
- You pick:
  - **What kind of softball questions** (batting, pitching, etc.)
  - **How many questions** (like choosing a short quiz or long quiz)
  - **How hard the questions should be** (like choosing easy, medium, or hard mode)

### 3. üè≠ **The Question Factory** (Question Generation)
- This is the **coolest part**! Our computer has a robot brain that makes up new questions
- It's like having a teacher who never runs out of creative test questions
- The robot looks at **78 different recipe cards** to make questions

### 4. üì∫ **The TV Screen** (Game State Overlay)
- Like watching a baseball game on TV with all the cool graphics
- Shows the inning, score, who's on base, etc.
- Makes you feel like you're really in a game!

### 5. ‚ùì **The Quiz Time** (QuizScreen)
- Like taking a test, but fun!
- You read the question and pick your answer
- Makes a cool "PING!" sound when you answer (like hitting a baseball!)

### 6. üé¨ **The Thinking Time** (LoadingScreen)
- Like when your computer is thinking really hard
- Shows cute animations while figuring out your score
- The computer is doing math to see how well you did

### 7. üèÜ **The Report Card** (ResultsScreen)
- Like getting your test back from the teacher
- Shows your score and gives you encouraging feedback
- Helps you learn from any mistakes you made

---

## üß† Understanding the "Robot Brain" (AI)

### What is AI?
**AI** stands for "Artificial Intelligence" - it's like giving a computer a pretend brain that can think and learn!

Think of it like this:
- üß∏ **Toy Robot**: Can only do what you program it to do (like walk forward, turn)
- ü§ñ **AI Robot**: Can think about problems and come up with new ideas!

### Our AI Helper: ChatGPT
We use a special AI called **ChatGPT** (made by a company called OpenAI):
- It's like having a super-smart friend who knows everything about softball
- We can ask it to create new questions, and it comes up with creative ones every time!
- It's also like having a really encouraging coach who gives helpful feedback

### How We Talk to the AI
We give the AI **instructions** (called "prompts") like:
> "Hey AI! Create a softball question about batting. Make it for someone who's just learning. The game situation is: bottom of the 3rd inning, there's a runner on first base, and the count is 2-1."

Then the AI thinks and creates a completely new question just for that situation!

## üèóÔ∏è How We Built This (The Technical Stuff Made Simple)

### Programming Languages (Our "Building Blocks")

#### 1. **TypeScript** - Our Main Language
- Think of this like the **instruction manual** for building with LEGO
- It tells the computer exactly what each piece does and how they fit together
- It's like regular English, but with very specific rules so computers can understand

#### 2. **HTML & CSS** - How Things Look
- **HTML**: Like the skeleton of a house (where everything goes)
- **CSS**: Like decorating and painting the house (making it look pretty)

#### 3. **React** - Our Building System
- Think of this like having **smart LEGO blocks** that can change and update themselves
- Instead of building something once, our blocks can change color, move around, or show different things based on what's happening

### The Framework: Next.js
This is like having a **really good instruction book** for building web apps:
- It handles all the complicated stuff for us
- Makes our app work on phones, tablets, and computers
- Helps everything load really fast

## üìÅ The File Cabinet: How We Organize Everything

Think of our project like a **really organized file cabinet**:

### üìÇ `src/app/` - The Main Office
- **`page.tsx`**: The front desk - first thing people see
- **`layout.tsx`**: The building's blueprint - how every room should look
- **`api/`**: The telephone system - how different parts talk to each other

### üìÇ `src/components/` - The Different Rooms
Each file is like a different room in our softball coaching center:

- **`WelcomeScreen.tsx`**: The lobby with welcome signs
- **`QuizSetupScreen.tsx`**: The registration desk where you sign up
- **`QuizScreen.tsx`**: The main classroom where you take the quiz
- **`LoadingScreen.tsx`**: The waiting room with entertainment
- **`ResultsScreen.tsx`**: The office where you get your results
- **`GameStateOverlay.tsx`**: The fancy TV screen that shows game info

### üìÇ `src/data/` - The Library
- **`prompt-templates.csv`**: A big book with 78+ different question recipes
- **`categoryInstructions.ts`**: Rule books for each type of softball question
- **`loadingMessages.ts`**: A collection of fun things to say while waiting

### üìÇ `src/services/` - The Helper Staff
These are like having different specialists who do specific jobs:

- **`questionService.ts`**: The librarian who finds the right question recipes
- **`gameStateGenerator.ts`**: The creative writer who makes up game scenarios
- **`eloService.ts`**: The math teacher who calculates your skill level
- **`csvParser.ts`**: The translator who reads our recipe book

### üìÇ `src/types/` - The Dictionary
- **`index.ts`**: Like a dictionary that explains what every word means in our app

### üìÇ `src/utils/` - The Tool Box
- **`sound.ts`**: The sound technician who makes the "PING!" noise

## üéØ The Magic Question Recipe System

### How We Make Questions
Instead of writing thousands of questions by hand, we created a **smart recipe system**:

#### 1. **The Recipe Cards** (Prompt Templates)
We have **78 different recipe cards** that tell the AI how to make questions:

```
Recipe #1: "Batting - Easy Level"
Instructions: "Create a question about when to swing at a pitch. 
Make it simple for beginners. Focus on the basics of good hitting."

Recipe #2: "Pitching - Hard Level"  
Instructions: "Create a question about advanced pitching strategy.
Include pitch selection and game situation awareness."
```

#### 2. **The Game Scenario Generator**
Before making a question, we create a **realistic game situation**:
- What inning is it?
- What's the score?
- Who's on base?
- What's the count (balls and strikes)?

It's like setting up a dollhouse before telling a story!

#### 3. **The Smart Categories**
We have **4 different types** of softball questions:
- **At Bat**: Questions about hitting and batting strategy
- **Pitching**: Questions about throwing and pitch selection  
- **Fielding**: Questions about catching and defensive plays
- **On Base**: Questions about base running and stealing

**Cool Feature**: Our system is smart enough to know that "On Base" questions need runners on base! If there's nobody on base, it doesn't make sense to ask about base running.

### The Question-Making Process
1. **You choose** what kind of questions you want
2. **Computer picks** a recipe card that matches your choice
3. **Computer creates** a realistic game scenario
4. **AI reads** the recipe and scenario, then creates a brand new question
5. **Computer shows** you the question with the TV-style game display

---

## üìä The Smart Difficulty System (ELO Rating)

### What is ELO?
**ELO** is like a **skill level number** for games. It was invented for chess, but we use it for softball knowledge!

Think of it like this:
- **800**: Just learning softball (like being in kindergarten)
- **1000**: Starting to understand the basics (like 3rd grade)
- **1200**: Pretty good at softball knowledge (like 5th grade)
- **1400**: Really good! (like middle school level)
- **1600**: Expert level (like high school varsity)

### How Our System Works
1. **You start** at 1000 (pretty good level)
2. **You can choose** to make it easier (800) or harder (1600)
3. **Computer finds** question recipes that match your level
4. **After the quiz**, your level might go up or down based on how you did

It's like having a coach who always gives you challenges that are *just right* - not too easy, not too hard!

## üé® The TV-Style Game Display

### Why We Made It Look Like TV
When you watch baseball on TV, you see cool graphics showing:
- The score
- What inning it is  
- Who's on base
- How many balls, strikes, and outs

We wanted our app to feel **just like watching a real game**!

### How We Built the Display
Think of it like building with **digital LEGOs**:

#### The Diamond (Baseball Field)
- We draw **4 small squares** in a diamond shape
- If someone's on base, we **color the square blue**
- If nobody's on base, we **leave it empty with just an outline**

#### The Circles (Balls, Strikes, Outs)
- We draw **small circles** in rows
- **Filled yellow circles** = something happened (like a ball or strike)
- **Empty gray circles** = nothing there yet

#### The Text (Game Information)
- We show what inning it is
- We show if your team is winning, losing, or tied
- Everything updates automatically based on the game scenario!

### Making It Work on Phones
We had to make sure everything fits on small phone screens:
- Made text smaller in some places
- Arranged things in a **smart layout** 
- Made sure you don't have to scroll to see everything

---

## üîä The Sound Effects System

### Why Sounds Matter
Sounds make the app more fun! When you hear that "PING!" of a bat hitting a ball, it makes you feel like you're really playing softball.

### How We Make Sounds
We have **two different ways** to make the bat sound:

#### Method 1: Computer-Generated Sound
- The computer **creates the sound from scratch** using math!
- It's like having a computer that can **sing** different notes
- We tell it: "Make a high note, then quickly make it lower, like a metal bat hitting a ball"

#### Method 2: Real Sound File
- We can use a **real recording** of a bat hitting a ball
- It's like having a **digital recording** saved on the computer
- We can control when it starts and stops playing

### Smart Sound Controls
- The sound **only plays the good part** (not the whole recording)
- It **starts 1.5 seconds** into the recording (skipping any quiet parts)
- It **stops after 2 seconds** (so it doesn't get annoying)

---

## üß© How All The Pieces Work Together

### The Data Flow (Like a Assembly Line)
Think of our app like a **toy factory assembly line**:

1. **üé™ Welcome Station**: Greets you and explains the rules
2. **üìã Order Station**: You tell us what you want (category, difficulty, count)
3. **üè≠ Recipe Kitchen**: Computer picks recipes and makes game scenarios  
4. **ü§ñ Question Factory**: AI creates custom questions based on recipes
5. **üì∫ Display Station**: Shows questions with cool TV graphics
6. **‚ö° Answer Processing**: Checks if you're right and gives feedback
7. **üèÜ Results Counter**: Calculates your score and new skill level

### The State Management (The App's Memory)
Our app has a **really good memory system** called "Context":

Think of it like a **magic notebook** that:
- **Remembers** what page you're on
- **Keeps track** of your answers
- **Knows** your current skill level
- **Updates** everything when something changes

It's like having a personal assistant who never forgets anything!

### Component Communication (How Parts Talk)
Our different "rooms" (components) need to talk to each other:

- **Welcome Screen** ‚Üí **Setup Screen**: "User is ready to start!"
- **Setup Screen** ‚Üí **Question Factory**: "Make 10 pitching questions at difficulty 1200!"
- **Quiz Screen** ‚Üí **Results Screen**: "Here are all the answers!"
- **Results Screen** ‚Üí **Setup Screen**: "User wants to play again!"

It's like having **walkie-talkies** between all the rooms!

## üõ†Ô∏è The Tools We Use (Like a Toolbox)

### Code Editor (Our Writing Tool)
- **VS Code**: Like a really smart word processor for code
- It **highlights** different parts in different colors
- It **helps us spell** code words correctly
- It **warns us** if we make mistakes

### Version Control (Our Time Machine)
- **Git**: Like having a time machine for our code
- We can **save snapshots** of our work
- If we break something, we can **go back** to when it worked
- Multiple people can work on the same project without messing each other up

### Package Manager (Our Ingredient Delivery)
- **npm**: Like having groceries delivered for cooking
- Instead of writing everything from scratch, we can **order pre-made ingredients**
- Need a slider? There's a package for that!
- Need to make API calls? There's a package for that too!

### Deployment (Putting It On The Internet)
- **Vercel**: Like having a **magic publishing company**
- We give them our code, and they **put it on the internet**
- Anyone in the world can use our app!
- When we update the code, it **automatically updates** the website
